        <h2> PARIS, EIFFEL TOWER </h2>
        <br>
        The Eiffel Tower was built to be one the main attractions at the Paris World's Fair in 1889. First called the 300-meter Tower, it soon took the name of the man who built it, Gustave Eiffel. Its height and unique silhouette floating above the Paris landscape quickly made the Eiffel Tower one of the most popular attractions in Paris. The Tower's destiny is closely linked to that of the city of Paris, the capital of France and the Eiffel Tower's owner.
