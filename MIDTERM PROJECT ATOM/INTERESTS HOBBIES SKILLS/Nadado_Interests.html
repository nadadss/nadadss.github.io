		<h2> INTERESTS ABOUT MEDICAL FIELD </h2>

		<div class = "block">
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<sup>(1)</sup> I'm not sure if I included this in my biography page but, I have interests in the field of medicine. <sup>(2)</sup> I got this kind of interest when I watched <b><q>Grey's Anatomy</q></b>. <sup>(3)</sup> <i> A series focusing on the lives of surgical interns, residents, and attending as they develop into seasoned doctors while balancing personal and professional relationships. <sup>(4)</sup> As the series progresses, they showcase different kinds of diseases, disorders or any complications that concerns the human health.</i> <sup>(5)</sup> As they showcase these different kinds of complications they also give different approaches on how to cure the diseases they are facing. <sup>(6)</sup> <b><i>This series is educational but not boring</i></b> (because some may think it will be boring since it's kind of educational in some way) because the series is filled with comedic scenes. <sup>(7)</sup> Despite the Educational and Comedic aspect of the series it is not advised to be watched by minors because it contains sexual and scenes that may be inapporpriate for minor audiences. <sup>(8)</sup> This paragraph is all about medical field. <sup>(9)</sup> Yes medical field it's wide because I am also interested on becoming a <b><i>Veterinarian</i></b> because I love animals, dogs in particular, but also animals that are cute. <sup>(10)</sup> I have a soft heart with dogs, whenever I see dogs I always try to get close to them and pet them but not stray dogs because the risk is there. <sup>(11)</sup> But whenever I see one, I feel sad because no one is taking care of them. <sup>(12)</sup> If only I have the chance and ability to take care of dogs, I would, but unfortunately I don't.

		<h2> INTERESTS ABOUT MUSIC AND DIRECTING </h2>

		<div class = "block">
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<sup>(1)</sup> When I was in the early years of junior high school, <b><i>my classmate taught me how to play a guitar</i></b>. <sup>(2)</sup> I had fun playing guitar because I've always dreamed of learning how to play an instrument. <sup>(3)</sup> Because of that, one time I borrowed the guitar of my classmate and bring it home to learn other songs, however my patience is very small. <sup>(4)</sup> I did learn some songs to play but I always don't finish those in learning. <sup>(5)</sup> It's like I just start it and once I think that I get the hang of it, I look for another song to play without mastering the previous one. <sup>(6)</sup> I was inconsistent in learning I don't know why, maybe my patience is short. <sup>(7)</sup> But one instrument that I really wanted to learn is playing a piano. <sup>(8)</sup> It always soothes my ears whenever I hear a piano. <sup>(9)</sup> I had a friend who played <b><q><i>River Flows in You</q> by Yiruma</i></b> and I was so amazed and kept on asking him to teach me but unfortunately he was not able to teach me because the piano got removed from their condominium to respect the silence of the environment there.<sup>(10)</sup> There was also this anime series that I watched titled <b><i>"Your Lie in April"</b></i> where one of the main characters is a pianist honed by his mother. <sup>(11)</sup> But when his mother died because of illness, his love for piano was lost. <sup>(12)</sup> But there was this person that keeps on annoying him to go back to playing piano, as the series progresses the main character got back to playing piano using that person as his inspiration. <sup>(13)</sup> But unfortunately that person was sick and later in the series, died. <sup>(14)</sup> I was saddened and thought of playing piano because of this series. <sup>(15)</sup> I also wanted to learn how to direct a play or film, I always get excited whenever we have plays in our school on junior high, but I think it's not for me because most of the time I don't understand the story deeply.

		<h2> INTERESTS ABOUT OTHER THINGS IN GENERAL </h2>

		<div class = "block">
				<br>
				<blockquote>
					<sup>(1)</sup> When I got to experience <b><i>FPS (First Person Shooter)</i></b> video games and seen many action themed movies, I also wanted to learn how to shoot a gun. <sup>(2)</sup> More specifically <b>snipers</b>. <sup>(3)</sup> Speaking of snipers I also wanted to learn archery. <sup>(4)</sup> One of the reasons I got this interest in archery is because of video games and animes. <sup>(5)</sup> Whenever we go to malls that have archery areas or whatever you call that, I always wanted to try it and learn how to hold a bow and shoot an arrow. <sup>(6)</sup> I also saw one movie called <b><i>"Robin Hood" played by Taron Egerton.</i></b> <sup>(7)</sup> He's so good at shooting arrows when he was aiming for the practice targets! <sup>(8)</sup> I want to learn how to shoot like him. <sup>(9)</sup> One more thing that I wanted to learn is how to cook. <sup>(10)</sup> Since I like eating, learning how to cook would be a plus and convenient for me because I can cook what I want. <sup>(11)</sup> <b><i>Also I want to cook for my future wife and kids.</i></b> <sup>(12)</sup> I mean most of the time people said that women should know how to cook, so that when they grew up and got married, they can cook for their family. <sup>(13)</sup> But for me I think learning how to cook as well not just my wife will be a good thing for the family. <sup>(14)</sup> And I think that would be a plus points to a guy if he knows how to cook right? <sup>(15)</sup> One last thing I want to learn everything my professors is teaching us right now. <sup>(16)</sup> Because of this pandemic, my mind mostly is out of this world. <sup>(17)</sup> What I meant about <b><i>"out of this world"</i></b> is that, sometimes my mind can't focus on what the professors are saying or discussing to us. <sup>(18)</sup> I mean it's really up to us if we want to listen or what, but back then when classes are still on face to face setup, even though I don't really listen sometimes, there are some learning that I am getting from the discussion on that day. <sup>(19)</sup> I hope that the classes goes back to normal or face to face setup soon.
