		<h2> HOBBIES </h2>
		<hr width = "50%" color = "black" size = "1" NOSHADE>

		<p><blockquote><sup>(1)</sup> Like most of the people who are at my age, one of my hobbies are playing video games. <sup>(2)</sup> Video games is my go to thing when I need space from something. <sup>(3)</sup> It's like after finishing school's assignment and activities, I play video games to relieve myself. <sup>(4)</sup> There are also times that I play video games before doing tasks, but I'm making sure that I will play for a short time only and after that I will work on my tasks. <sup>(5)</sup> Fortunately, it's working and there are no tasks that is not being done as scheduled. <sup>(6)</sup> I also watch TV series and anime when I have the time. <sup>(7)</sup> My brother introduced me to anime when he was in high school. <sup>(8)</sup> At first I don't like it because I can't understand the language and I don't like to read subtitles because I don't really understand it very well. <sup>(9)</sup> But as time passes by, I got used to watching it. <sup>(10)</sup> I got to learn English from it time to time also, because when I don't understand what they're saying, I go to the dictionary to look it up. <sup>(11)</sup> One more thing that I know for sure a lot of people relate to is eating. <sup>(12)</sup> I looked it up on <cite>Google</cite>, and it claimed that eating may be considered a hobby if it's something I love doing. <sup>(13)</sup> And again one of my hobbies are eating. <sup>(14)</sup> Eating is my stress reliever, my reward to myself when I achieve something, my everyday thing to do, because of course, you can't live without food. <sup>(15)</sup> Water can temporarily satisfy you but it doesn't have the nutrients that we get naturally from foods. <sup>(16)</sup> Especially now during pandemic, most of us use food as our coping mechanim to cure our anxiety, because most people can't go out because of the virus. <sup>(17)</sup> So what we do is eat at home because there may be many things to do but eating is what pops into our mind first. <sup>(18)</sup> I sometimes read also, whenever I find books or <i>E-books</i> that gets my interests. <sup>(19)</sup> <b><em>Reading strikes me as a creative activity in life since it requires you to utilize your imagination to better comprehend the book you're reading.</em></b> <sup>(20)</sup> You should also use your imagination to construct a setting similar to the one described in the book. <sup>(21)</sup> It's corny yes specially for a guy to say this but, I like romcom books and movies, or those that have a little bit of romance in it. <sup>(22)</sup> I mean, it's a good novel, especially if you don't always get your fill of <q><b>kilig</b></q> in life. <sup>(23)</sup> Before I thought of it as a corny genre, but I like it now. <sup>(24)</sup> Back then I play sports with my classmates and friends after class. <sup>(25)</sup> I developed my skills in sports because of them, because we always play, we find times to play sports. <sup>(26)</sup> We play even though we are using daily uniforms which is composed of polo and slacks which is very hard for us to play so sometimes we bring shorts or we wear shorts inside the slacks. <sup>(27)</sup> Reminiscing about it makes me want to 	play now. <sup>(28)</sup> I can't play now because I got into an accident that caused my left wrist's bone dislocated and fractured. <sup>(29)</sup> It recovered from it, but not totally, because the bone is still kind of sticking out.</blockquote></p>

		<h2> INTERESTS </h2>
		<hr width = "50%" color = "black" size = "1" NOSHADE>

		<p><blockquote><sup>(1)</sup> One of the things that I wanted to learn is how to drive a car. <sup>(2)</sup> My brother has his own car, and I always ask him to teach me how to drive. <sup>(3)</sup> One day our cousin wants to hang out so she can try driving my brother's car, luckily I was also there so my brother asked our cousin to teach me how to drive and there I had my first driving lesson. <sup>(4)</sup> Today, I'm currently enrolled in a practical driving course and I'm so happy because I will be able to learn how to drive from a driving coach. <sup>(5)</sup> We went around manila while learning how to drive and it was so fun. <sup>(6)</sup> I'm not sure if I put this in my biography page but, I'm really into medical related stuffs. <sup>(7)</sup> Like what causes this kind of disease or illness to happen. <sup>(8)</sup> If only I am that sturdy and intelligent I would've taken <b>Medical Technology</b> as my college program. <sup>(9)</sup> I got into this kind of interest because of <q><b>Grey's Anatomy</b></q>. <sup>(10)</sup> Even though it's a series that is full of <i>Rated 18</i> stuffs, but once they talk about cases about their patients, they always caught my attention which makes me want to learn what causes it to happen, especially those cases that are very unique to me like first time seen. <sup>(11)</sup> When I got to experience <b>FPS</b> <i>(First Person Shooter)</i> video games and seen many action themed movies, I also wanted to learn how to shoot a gun. <sup>(12)</sup> More specifically, snipers. <sup>(13)</sup> Speaking of snipers I also wanted to learn archery. <sup>(14)</sup> One of the reasons I got this interest is because of video games too and also anime. <sup>(15)</sup> Whenever we go to malls that have archery areas or whatever you call that, I always wanted to try it and learn how to hold a bow and shoot an arrow. <sup>(16)</sup> I also saw one movie called <b><q>Robin Hood</q></b> that was played by <i>Taron Egerton</i>. <sup>(17)</sup> <strong>He's so good at shooting arrows when he was aiming for the practice targets!</strong> I want to learn how to shoot like him. <sup>(18)</sup> One more thing that I wanted to learn is how to cook. Since I like eating, learning how to cook would be a plus and convenient for me because I can cook what I want. <sup>(19)</sup> Also I want to cook for my future wife and kids. <sup>(20)</sup> I mean most of the time people said that women should know how to cook, so that when they grew up and got married, they can cook for their family. <sup>(21)</sup> But for me I think learning how to cook as well not just my wife will be a good thing for the family. <sup>(22)</sup> And I think that would be a plus points to a guy if he knows how to cook right? <sup>(23)</sup> One last thing I want to learn everything my professors is teaching us right now. <sup>(24)</sup> Because of this pandemic, my mind mostly is out of this world. <sup>(25)</sup> What I meant about <b><q>out of this world</q></b> is that, sometimes my mind can't focus on what the professors are saying or discussing to us. <sup>(26)</sup> I mean it's really up to us if we want to listen or what, but back then when classes are still on face to face setup, even though I don't really listen sometimes, there are some learning that I am getting from the discussion on that day. <sup>(27)</sup> I hope that the classes goes back to normal or face to face setup soon. </blockquote></p>

		<h2> SKILLS </h2>
		<hr width = "50%" color = "black" size = "1" NOSHADE>

		<p><blockquote><sup>(1)</sup> I'm not sure if this can be considered as a skill, but not everyone can be fast in typing. <sup>(2)</sup> I can sometimes do 80 <b>WPM</b> <i>(Words per Minute)</i> if that's even fast enough. <sup>(3)</sup> Back then when we are task to report as a group, I occasionally offer to type since I am too lazy to hunt up information on the internet. <sup>(4)</sup> I also volunteer in creating powerpoints but they got to decide the design because I really don't have skills in designing. <sup>(5)</sup> Some people also say that I'm a good dancer but I don't really believe it. <sup>(6)</sup> But since I love dancing I learned to accept it.  <sup>(7)</sup> Also, sometimes they rely on me to teach them when there are group tasks that involves dancing. <sup>(8)</sup> I'm not really the kind of person who choreographs my own dances, instead I look at some dance videos and try to copy it. <sup>(9)</sup> When I was young, my aunt also asked me to help her teach a group of students for a dancing contest in their school. <sup>(10)</sup> I don't really reacall this clearly but when I was in Grade 1, I was also pulled to join my classmates to perform a dance in a certain event. <sup>(11)</sup> I've also included this in my biography and I think in my hobbies that I play sport which can be considered physical skill. <sup>(12)</sup> I learned how to play sport when I was on grade 7. <sup>(13)</sup> I discovered it myself, because when I was on grade 6 and seen how volleyball is being played, I got interested on it and want to learn. <sup>(14)</sup> In my first year of veing a varsity player, I didn't really get to hold the ball that much because there are still seniors who's playing and knows the game very well. <sup>(15)</sup> But I remember our school didn't win any match that year. <sup>(16)</sup> Actually our team didn't win any of the interschool events but in my senior years or late senior years we had a teammate who's really good in playing volleyball and he and his younger brother carried the team to win few matches. <sup>(17)</sup> I can also say that I am confident when I talk to strangers. <sup>(18)</sup> For example I wanted to ask for directions, I don't hesitate to ask a stranger. <sup>(19)</sup> Another one is let's say I'm in the mood of joking with my family, I sometimes involve a stranger with no particular reasons. <sup>(20)</sup> I know that doing that thing is kind of risky so I make sure that I'm meddling the correct person so that I won't make him/her annoyed with me. <sup>(21)</sup> I'm not really sure if you can call that confident, or just brave. <sup>(22)</sup> I'm also not sure if you can call that a skill. <sup>(23)</sup> Lastly, the skill that I am very proud of is that <u><em>I work pretty well with a team.</em></u> <sup>(24)</sup> I think that's a skill because you really have to learn how to work as a team and not all people can do this. <sup>(25)</sup> Some people prefer to work alone because they think they are faster and more productive. <sup>(26)</sup> But once you grow up, and starts to work for a company, working as a team is very vital because you may have differences at work but there at some instances that they more about the company than you. </blockquote></p>
