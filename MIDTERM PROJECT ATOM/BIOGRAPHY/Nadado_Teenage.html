                <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(1)</sup>This is the part where I think I am in my most rebellious stage which I think most teenagers are also in their life. <sup>(2)</sup>This is also where I got my first sport ever. <sup>(3)</sup>I think you would assume that it's Basketball, but no. <sup>(4)</sup>I always hated playing basketball. <sup>(5)</sup>I view basketball as one of the violent sport I've ever seen, and I really hate violence. <sup>(6)</sup>I was a part of our school's men's volleyball team for 6 years, at first I don't really know how to play this sport but I just felt that I will do okay in this sport. <sup>(7)</sup>Our coach is our PE teacher and he was the one training us. <sup>(8)</sup>I don't really like our coach that much because it feels like he always have a bad aura towards me. <sup>(9)</sup>When talking, it feels like he's mad but sometimes after training the team goes out and eat early dinner. <sup>(10)</sup>In my teenage life, Senior High School is the best year of my High School life, although it is also kind of worst. <sup>(11)</sup>This is the year where our batch is the most active people in the school. <sup>(12)</sup>In High School years, petty fights are very common, so yes there are so many petty fights in our batch but I am not part of it. <sup>(13)</sup>Yes I can say this clearly because as I've said, I really hate fights. <sup>(14)</sup>This also is the year where I had a hard time looking for friends.<sup>(15)</sup> Imagine I am with these people since my first year of being High School and yet I haven't really found my truest friend ever. <sup>(16)</sup>I was in a circle of friends in my early years of High School but as it progresses the circle broke up. <sup>(17)</sup>Since I don't really have friends in those years I always try to socialize and make friends with other circles. <sup>(18)</sup>But as I do it, I realize that I don't want to ruin their circle, so I stopped trying. <sup>(19)</sup>But I've got this one person where I felt like I am being comforted, I don't really share my problems and other secrets to this person but I just felt like whenever I'm with that person, I don't need anyone anymore. That person is my girlfriend now. <sup>(20)</sup>Anyway, Senior High School year is also one of the toughest years I've had because of researches and major subject that differs on your track. <sup>(21)</sup>I took <b>STEM</b> as my track because some people say IT is in this track, but I don't see the part where we apply the learnings I got in STEM today, or maybe I didn't learn anything? <sup>(22)</sup>I think I got scammed. <sup>(23)</sup>With regards to researches I got lucky that my groupmates in our first research is one of my closest people I think I have. <sup>(24)</sup>Our research project went successful and we managed to fill a spot in one of the best researches in our batch. <sup>(25)</sup>I don't think I deserve that cause I feel like I didn't do much, and my groupmates are brainy and I just got carried. <sup>(26)</sup>My last year of High School was fun because we did everything just to win every competitions in our school's events. <sup>(27)</sup>Fortunately, we won some. <sup>(28)</sup>To sum it up, My teenage years is fun and full of rocky roads even though we graduated online only -_-. <sup>(29)</sup>I've done so many bad or terrible things, and I don't regret some of them. <sup>(30)</sup>I believe that it is part of growing up and I want to experience it while I have the time because as I reach college,my time will be limited because it will be tougher than before.</blockquote></p>
