                <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(1)</sup>Year 2001 when my mom gave birth to a kid named Kevin Bryan. <sup>(2)</sup>I don't really recall much about my childhood years but I will try my best to share it to you. <sup>(3)</sup>I was raised with a slight deformation in my head. <sup>(4)</sup>You can't obviously see it but it's there. <sup>(5)</sup>My mom said that I always twist my head to the side and she can't contain it. <sup>(6)</sup>So what she did is I think put a wood in the side of my head so that it will remain straight. <sup>(7)</sup>Because of that I can't cut my hair bald. <sup>(8)</sup>If you will look in my right eyebrow there is a scar above it and my mom and siblings said that I got it from an accident where I bump my head in a glass and hit an artery resulting to a blood spurt. <sup>(9)</sup>They said my mom was on work and one of my siblings called her and ran me to the <i>ER</i>. <sup>(10)</sup>They're not telling me what happened and how did it happened. <sup>(11)</sup>One thing I know for sure is that one of my sibling caused the accident. <sup>(12)</sup>I can see it from their faces and they're in denial. <sup>(13)</sup>But it's okay, it happened and I got over it. <sup>(14)</sup>I started my preschool in <i><u>Morning Bells Learning Center</u></i>, it's close to our house which is very convenient for my mom because she's going to work after she escorts me to the school. <sup>(15)</sup>I remembered we always buy <i>Lemon Square</i> cheesecake and <i>Zesto</i> in the store close to the school. <sup>(16)</sup>Sadly the store is gone now, because it was demolished for the expansion of the school I think. <sup>(17)</sup>After I graduated preschool, I went to <i><u>Sacred Heart of Jesus Catholic School</u></i> for my gradeschool and highschool year. <sup>(18)</sup>At first I am very shy because, some of my classmates known each other because they live in the same area and others took their preschool here also. <sup>(19)</sup>But as time progresses, I learned to socialize with them. <sup>(20)</sup>Grade School is my worst years of my life as of now. I don't want to mention what happen that made me say that, but it was so terrible. <sup>(21)</sup>Anyways, I was in 4th grade when I knew that there is an event in the school where we get to do anything we want, in some schools they call it foundation day, but for us we call it <i>Intramurals</i>. <sup>(22)</sup>There are classrooms with their assigned booths but you have to pay to play, it sucks yes but it was kinda fun because I don't really have money when I was a kid. <sup>(23)</sup>This is also the year where we are allowed to join a club and I tried Dance Troupe club because I love dancing, until now. <sup>(24)</sup>Sadly I was not accepted and join a different club. <sup>(25)</sup>I can't recall what club I ended up to but all I can think of is that I joined in an art club even though I don't know how to draw. <sup>(26)</sup>I can draw stick man though I assure you that. <sup>(27)</sup>5th grade there was an indoor game event in our school and they need participants per section, I joined as a chess player for our section and I almost won the event if I only held the right piece correctly. <sup>(28)</sup>Because of that, the 6th grade player I fought with in that chess match wants to play with me again. <sup>(29)</sup>Sadly he will graduate after that year because he's a 6th grader. <sup>(30)</sup>6th grade, I graduated in spite of my laziness and not reviewing when periodical exams are near. <sup>(31)</sup>As some kids are, I also hate taking pictures so in the pictures my mom took when I graduated, It's either I am grumpy or I'm not looking.</blockquote></p>
