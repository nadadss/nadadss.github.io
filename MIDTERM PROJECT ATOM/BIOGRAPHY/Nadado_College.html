                <p><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>(1)</sup>I don't really have something to say that much in this year because I'm still a 2nd year student and hopefully 2 years more before graduating, but upon searching schools for College, these people I have now and I are having a hard time because we don't know what school to apply. <sup>(2)</sup>We are kind of late to look for schools because before the pandemic, there are some preparations that has to be done before our school year ends, and when the pandemic started the people are not allowed to go out because we are on full lockdown. <sup>(3)</sup>I've always dreamt of going to UST but I am not that brainy and financially stable so I disregarded that school. <sup>(4)</sup>My friend recommended UE because UE is one of the best schools when it comes to IT course, so we applied and took the entrance exam and luckily got accepted. <sup>(5)</sup>Here we are now in UE one of the warriors. <sup>(6)</sup>Before first year started my friends and I prepared something that they said is needed as the year started, we also tried to learn some programming languages but nope we didn't finish it. <sup>(7)</sup> We only did it for a day and the next day we are savoring the remaining days before our college year starts. <sup>(8)</sup> First year started and I was very excited yet nervous because I think I will have a hard time learning in an online setup. <sup>(9)</sup>What I think about me having a hard time learning in an online setup turns out to be a fact. <sup>(10)</sup>It's really hard to listen, there are connection interruptions there are distractions and it's very different in a face to face setup. <sup>(11)</sup>I was so excited in our first programming language Python, I was very happy when I did the <b>"Hello World!"</b> and got interested in the course. <sup>(12)</sup>Our first assignments are in an adequate level for me. <sup>(13)</sup>When logics are being used I can't keep up anymore. <sup>(14)</sup>That time I think I don't have the level of IQ necessary for this course. <sup>(15)</sup>I keep messing up. <sup>(16)</sup>There is this activity or assignment we had for an hour and a half, an hour have passed and my work is not even in 50% progress, I don't know what to do anymore. <sup>(17)</sup>That's the day where I felt shifting college program is the best to do. <sup>(18)</sup>Fortunately there are people who are willing to help and yes I managed to overcome that day, I submitted my code but late, it's okay though because I won't be submitting anything if those people who helped is not there. <sup>(19)</sup>When 2nd sem started in first year, that happened also but this time it's java language, but somehow I'm starting to pick up some logics but don't know how to incorporate it with coding. <sup>(20)</sup>I think coding is not for me. <sup>(21)</sup>Database is fun though, when we are creating database in MS ACCESS, I had fun but not so much, because I know for sure that this is just the start and things will get tougher. <sup>(22)</sup>As I've said things got tougher for database. <sup>(23)</sup>2nd year 1st sem, we had our first database coding. <sup>(24)</sup>As usual it is easy to follow because it's still basic, but when the subquery and joins are introduced, my mind blew up and had a hard time how to use these joins and how to use subqueries. <sup>(25)</sup>I watched videos in youtube to help me understand subqueries and joins even better and it somehow helped me so I got to keep up the pace of our professor when teaching. <sup>(26)</sup>As for our programming language last sem, it was okay actually our professor is not fast pacing in teaching us. <sup>(27)</sup>We focused on enhancing our simulation skills and with a few tries, I managed to get the hang of it. <sup>(28)</sup>As of now 2nd year 1st sem is the most exhausting year in my college years because there are so many things to code, code in c#, code in database, and code in java where we are being taught concepts only. <sup>(29))</sup>I don't learn from concepts only, I am a type of person that learns when demonstrating, but our professor didn't demostrate it, just showing premade codes. <sup>(30)</sup>I didn't learn anything on that subject. <sup>(31)</sup>It's so difficult implementing methods in Java. <sup>(32)</sup>There is also the time where we are required to create a game. <sup>(33)</sup><strong>WE DON'T EVEN HAVE AN IDEA HOW TO CREATE A GAME</strong>, that activity was the hardest as ever, I only referenced my work in a premade game I saw on YouTube. <sup>(34)</sup>I was relieved when I managed to get it done. <sup>(35)</sup>Most of the time whenever I do task that I think are way out of my capabilities, I feel anxious because I think I won't be able to do. <sup>(36)</sup>But after that I got to realize that someday I may have to do this again and it will be harder than this. <sup>(37)</sup>So I think it's okay to have hard times or tasks in life because I think that will make you grow and enables you to be tougher than that. <sup>(38)</sup>But I hope that this year, there won't be activites or assignments for us that are not discussed properly and given any background with. <sup>(39)</sup>All in all, I expect that this stage of life will be full of hardships that will make me grow and fun times that will make my college years amazing. <sup>(40)</sup> I'm having fun with my classmates so far and I hope all of us will graduate together.</blockquote></p>
