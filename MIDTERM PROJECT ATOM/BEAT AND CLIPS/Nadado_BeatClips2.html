		<h3> RNB SONGS </h3>

			<ul>

				<li> <p> NE-YO </p> <img src = "../PHOTO GALLERY/IMAGES/neyo.jpg" alt=""> <br> <audio controls src = "AUDIO/neyo.mp3"></audio> </li>

				<li> <p> USHER </p>  <img class = "mid" src = "../PHOTO GALLERY/IMAGES/usher.jpg" alt=""> <br> <audio controls src = "AUDIO/usher.mp3"></audio>  </li>

			</ul>

			<ul>

				<li class = "width"> Ne-Yo created the album "Year of the Gentleman" which the song Miss Independent belongs to, because he felt that's what is needed on that day. He feels that the essence of what it is to be a gentleman needs to be brought back in the industry.  </li>

				<li class = "mid"> "Love in This Club Part II" is a song recorded by American R&B singer Usher, and features rapper Lil Wayne and fellow singer Beyoncé. It is a sequel to the album's lead single "Love in This Club" which features Young Jeezy.   </li>

				<li class = "width"> 	The Weeknd has consistently portrayed himself as a free bird unable to tie himself down to one girl. Here, despite his lover's attempts to fix him, he can't stop himself from spending time with other women. For The Weeknd, it's too big a sacrifice to commit to one partner. </li>
